Sustainability AQI Prediction

This project predicts the Air Quality Index (AQI) using pollution data such as PM2.5, PM10, and CO levels.

🧠 Project Workflow

Collected and cleaned air quality dataset (city_day.csv)

Visualized data trends and correlations using heatmaps and graphs

Built and trained a Linear Regression model

Saved the model as aqi_prediction_model.pkl

Predicted AQI values based on pollution levels

📊 Technologies Used

Python

Pandas

Matplotlib

Seaborn

Scikit-learn

Google Colab

🏁 Result

The model achieved R² = 0.90 and can predict AQI for given pollution values.
